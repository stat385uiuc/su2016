# Overview

*R* is often confusing for newcomers to *use* and sometimes the amount of
interactivity is limited by knowing the right function call to manipulate the
data. *Shiny* attempts to resolve this by providing a means to create an interface
between a web browser and *R* such that a user does not need to be an expert.
In fact, they can simply use dropdown menus, numeric inputs, sliders, and so on
to specify values and have calculations automatically done for them. Furthermore,
*Shiny* provides a means to *standardize* exploration of data as the user
is forced to rely upon what is implemented within a User Interface (UI).
